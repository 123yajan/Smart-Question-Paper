# Contour Analysis with OpenCV
This project demonstrates how to use OpenCV's contour finding functions to detect contours in an image and compute the centroid and area of each contour. The results are printed to the console.

## Introduction
Contour detection is a fundamental task in computer vision, where contours are used to represent the boundaries of objects in an image. This project demonstrates how to detect these contours and compute relevant properties such as their centroids and areas using OpenCV.

## Requirements
Python 3.x
OpenCV

## Usage

- Clone the repository or download the script.
- Replace 'path/to/your/image.png' with the path to your image file in the script.

## Installation
To run this project, you need to have Python and OpenCV installed. You can install OpenCV using pip:


```bash
pip install opencv-python 
```
